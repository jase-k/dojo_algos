// Save The World:
// The apocalypse finally happened. There was a massive outbreak, a pandemic with no cure. 
// The world has been torn apart, cities crumbled to the ground, no hope for mankind in sight. 
// After 3 years of surviving you find yourself and your group traveling towards a small town somewhere 
// in the MidWest. On the side of the road lay a dying man. Your group tries to help him but the 
// sickness has taken over and he only has moments left. With his last words he tells you that there is a cure.
// "In the tall building at the end of the road, on the 6th floor, at the end of the hall, there is a room 
// with a digital scale and a cabinet. Inside the cabinet are 20 pill bottles, each bottle containing 20 pills each. One bottle contains the cure, the pills in that bottle weigh 1.01 grams each. The rest of 
// the bottles contain pills that weigh 1 gram each and when consumed will kill you. The scale in the room 
// works but it only has enough battery life to weigh something once. It will give you one reading then it 
// will die..." 

//Take 0 pills out of the 1st bottle, 1 pill out of the second bottle, 2 pills, out of the third bottle
//Until you have 20 bottles all with different number of pills in them. 
//you weigh all the bottles together and whatever the scale says after the decimal is the amount of 'cure' pills on the scale
// for example 210.12 g of weight would equate to the cure bottle being the one with 12 pills left in the bottle. 




// Make McClain Proud:
// You have a 3-gallon and a 5-gallon jug that you can fill from a fountain of water.
// The problem is to fill one of the jugs with exactly 4 gallons of water. How do you do it?

// Fill the 3 gallon bucket and dump its contents into the 5 gallon bucket
// Fill the 3 gallon bucket again and dump its contents into the 5 gallon bucket until it is full. 
// You remain with 1 gallon in the 3 gallon bucket. 
// dump out the 5 gallon bucket and fill it with the 1 gallon remaining in the 3 gallon bucket
// fill the 3 gallon bucket again and dump it into the 5 gallon bucket to have exactly 4 gallons of water in the 5 gallon bucket 



// Apples and Oranges:
// There are three boxes, one contains only apples, one contains only oranges, 
// and one contains both apples and oranges. The boxes have been incorrectly 
// labeled such that no label identifies the actual contents of its box. 
// Opening just one box, and without looking in the box, you take out one piece of fruit. 
// By looking at the fruit, how can you immediately label all of the boxes correctly?

//take a piece of fruit from the box labeled orange & apple
//if its an apple, you know the contents of the box is only apples
//therefore you know that the box labeled oranges has to contain both
// and the box labeld apples has to contain oranges
