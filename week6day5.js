// # Finding An Average on the Down Low #

// Three Employees want to know the average of their salaries. They are not allowed to share their individual salaries.
// * They cannot directly share their own salaries in anyway, which includes writing things down. 

// 150 = (A - 150) + (B-150) + (C-150)
// X = (300-A) + (300-B) + (300-C)
// Avg = X/3
// C = Avg - ((A -Avg) + (B-Avg))
// A = 100
// B = 150
// C = 200 

// C = 150 - ((-50) + (0)
// C = 150 - (-50)

// # Card Flip Shuffle #

// You are in a dark room with a deck of cards. A certain number of the cards are face up and the rest are face down. You can't see the cards. How do you divide the deck in to two piles with equal numbers of face up cards in each? ##

// * You know how many cards are flipped, but you cannot see the deck of cards no matter what and the deck is shuffled, so the flipped cards could be anywhere in the deck.

//Cut every card in half and put them into two piles. Otherwise ... insolvable.


//==========================================
// if two cards are flipped 

//all cards are flipped : you cut the deck in half
//all cards are flipped but 2 : 

//deck: 3 cards 
//2 are flipped

// Bonus riddle: -> Alarm Clock

// John gave his brother James a box:
// About it there were many locks.
// James woke and said it gave him pain;
// So gave it back to John again.
// The box was not with lid supplied
// Yet caused two lids to open wide: // eyelids = alarm clock
// And all these locks had never a key
// What kind of box, then, could it be?

//Locks without keys: 
// locks of hair
// lox on a bagel
